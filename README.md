# smart_parking_system

In this project, I have designed a smart parking system, using Arduino IDE and Processing IDE. This system enables users to check whether there is any free parking spot available without manually going and looking for parking spaces.
I have also used Node-Red and IBM Watson assistant for making the app and the chatbot to assist the users to book a parking slot for a particular time
